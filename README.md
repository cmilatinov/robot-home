## Description
The Smart Home Simulator (SHS) is a software that allows the user to run simulations of a smart home system  with multiple features. The purpose of the SHS is to allow users to automate tasks and services to overcome daily routine tasks. Different modules are implemented in the SHS that allow independent home appliances to be utilized. As a result, various home appliances such as lightning, heating, ventilation and climate control are automated when all the devices are connected to the internet. The user, which has specific permissions depending on his status, runs the simulations on a dashboard, where he can edit and modify all the parameters of the simulation. The Smart home core functionality (SHC) which is already implemented for the first deliverable, executes general commands with the lights, doors, windows and people. The Smart home security (SHP) module is used to make sure that the house is protected from intruders by using sensors to identify undesired people. Also, the Smart Heating (SHH) Module controls multiple heating zones in the house and has multiple features that allows the temperatures to rise or decrease according to certain conditions. All these features compose the Smart Home Simulator, which a user can use to run multiple scenarios of a smart home system.
